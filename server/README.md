### Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm i express pg sequelize dotenv cors
```

This will install the Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize packages.

> Don't forgot to install `Nodemon`

`Nodemon` is a utility depended on about 3 million projects, that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. Perfect for development.

Swap nodemon instead of node to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes. To install, get Node.js, then from your terminal run:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

### Architecture

The application is structured in the following directories:

| Directory Architecture                       | Description                        |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| [config](../server/docs/config/config.md)           | This directory contains the config for the application to rely with database  |
| [controllers](../server/docs/controllers/userController.md) | This directory contains the controllers for the application  |
| [models](../server/docs/models/userModel.md)           | This directory contains the models for the application  |
| [routes](../server/docs/routes.md)           | This directory contains the routes for the application  |
| [util](../server/docs/util.md)               | This directory contains the utility functions for the application.  |


### Library used
| Library | Description | Usage Examples |
|---|---|---|
| [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) | Nodemon is a tool that automatically restarts your Node.js application whenever you make a change to your code. This can be helpful for development, as it allows you to see the changes you make to your code reflected in your application without having to manually restart your server. | `nodemon app.js` |
| [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) | Dotenv is a module that allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file into your Node.js application. This can be useful for storing sensitive information, such as database credentials, in a file that is not checked into your source code. | `require('dotenv').config()` |
| [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) | Sequelize is a popular ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for Node.js. It allows you to interact with a relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, using JavaScript objects. | `const sequelize = require('sequelize');` |
| [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) | CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows you to make HTTP requests from one domain to another. This can be useful for developing single-page applications (SPAs) that need to access resources from a different domain. | `const cors = require('cors');` |
| [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) | pg is a PostgreSQL client for Node.js. It allows you to connect to a PostgreSQL database and execute queries. | `const pg = require('pg');` |


## Express.js

Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools and utilities that make it easy to develop web applications.

| Feature     | Description |
|-------------|---|
| **Routing** | Express.js provides a routing system that allows you to define how your application will respond to HTTP requests. 

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello World !")
})
```
|             |  |
|-------------|---|
| **Middleware** | Middleware is code that is executed before or after a route is called. It can be used to do things like authenticate users, validate requests, or log errors.

```js
app.use(express.json()); // Parses JSON requests
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Parses URLencoded requests
```

|             |  |
|-------------|---|
| **Views** | Express.js can be used to render templates. Templates are files that contain HTML code that is dynamically generated by your application.

```js
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
    res.render("users.ejs", { users: [...] }); // Renders the users.ejs template, passing in the users array as an object
});
```

|             |  |
|-------------|---|
| **Modules** | Express.js has a large ecosystem of modules that can be used to extend its functionality. Some popular modules include:

|             |  |
|-------------|---|
| **BodyParser** | Parses HTTP request bodies.
| **CORS** | Enables cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
| **Mongoose** | A MongoDB ORM.
| **Sequelize** | A MySQL/PostgreSQL ORM.

```js
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const cors = require("cors");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const sequelize = require("sequelize");

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(cors());
app.use(mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb"));
app.use(sequelize.initialize());
```
