### Routes

The routes directory in a Node.js application typically contains the routes for the application. These routes define how the application will respond to HTTP requests.

Here is an example of a route for a GET request to the /users endpoint:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Get all users from the database.
  const users = await User.findAll();

  // Send the users to the client.
  res.json(users);
});

module.exports = router;
```

This route will get all users from the database and send them to the client.
