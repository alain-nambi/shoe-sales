#### Lucide React

To use Lucide React, you need to import the LucideIcon component and pass the name of the icon you want to use as a prop. For example:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { LucideIcon } from 'lucide-react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <LucideIcon name="home" />
    );
  }
}
```
